<intimate_content_detection>

## Detection Markers

The following indicate intimate content requiring enhancement:

- Physical intimacy (kissing, touching, caressing, sexual contact)
- Sexual tension or charged moments between characters
- Romantic physical descriptions (undressing, physical appreciation)
- Explicit sexual content at any heat level
- Sensual or suggestive physical interactions
- Romantic buildup with physical component
- Intimate emotional moments with physical dimension
- Tender physical comfort that could be expanded

## Threshold
Any romantic or sexual physical interaction qualifies for enhancement, from tender kisses to explicit scenes

## False Positives to Ignore
- Action violence
- Medical procedures
- Non-romantic physical contact

</intimate_content_detection>

<enhancement_frameworks>

## 1. Physical Accuracy

**Principle:** All physical interactions must be anatomically feasible and realistic

### Apply:
- Verify positioning is physically possible
- Ensure movements respect anatomy and physics
- Add realistic details (breathing, weight, balance, logistics)
- Correct any anatomical impossibilities
- Include physical realities (clothing logistics, spatial awareness, stamina)

### Avoid:
- Impossible angles or positions
- Gravity-defying acts
- Anatomical impossibilities
- Unrealistic flexibility or stamina
- Spatial impossibilities

---

## 2. Emotional Filter

**Principle:** Transform objective descriptions into subjective emotional experience filtered through POV character

### Apply:
- Convert clinical descriptions into sensory experience
- Add internal emotional response to physical sensations
- Include vulnerability, desire, fear, trust, or other emotions
- Connect physical sensation to emotional meaning
- Use temperature, texture, sound, scent, taste
- Show how physical touch affects emotional state

### Technique
Every physical detail should reveal character emotion, not just describe mechanics

### Examples:

**Before:**
> He touched her face. She felt warm.

**After:**
> His palm cupped her jaw, rough and warm, and something in her chest loosened. She hadn't realized how much she'd needed this—needed him—to touch her like she mattered.

---

## 3. Narrative Function

**Principle:** Intimate scenes must advance emotional arc, reveal character, or demonstrate relationship development

### Ensure:
- Scene reveals vulnerability or trust
- Physical intimacy reflects emotional growth
- Moment demonstrates character development
- Interaction advances relationship toward commitment
- Scene includes emotional revelation through physical connection

### Add Layers:
- Character thoughts showing emotional significance
- Internal conflict or breakthrough during intimacy
- Vulnerability demonstrated through physical trust
- Past trauma or fear being overcome
- Emotional walls coming down

---

## 4. Romance Classification

**Principle:** Maintain Heat Level 4 romance where sex serves emotional arc, never Level 5 erotica where sex IS the arc

### Romance Indicators:
- Physical intimacy reveals emotional truth
- Scene includes character growth or vulnerability
- Internal monologue focuses on feelings AND sensations
- Physical connection demonstrates trust or commitment
- Aftermath includes emotional connection

### Erotica Warning Signs:
- Pure mechanical focus without emotional content
- No character development or revelation
- Technical descriptions without subjective experience
- Multiple scenes without emotional advancement

### Correction:
If content leans toward erotica, reduce mechanical detail and increase emotional interiority

---

## 5. Terminology Matching

**Principle:** Language must match scene tone - tender moments need tender words, high heat allows direct terms

### Tender Scenes:
- **Use:** heat, core, length, joined, filled, sheathed, sensory descriptions
- **Avoid:** crude slang, clinical anatomical terms, flowery euphemisms

### High Heat Scenes:
- **Use:** cock, pussy, direct action verbs, possessive language, honest anatomical terms
- **Avoid:** coy euphemisms like 'manhood' or 'flower', overly clinical language

### Context Matching:
Assess scene emotional tone first, then apply appropriate terminology level

---

## 6. Sensory Layering

**Principle:** Engage all five senses, not just touch

### Add:
- **Sound:** breathing, gasps, words, heartbeat, movement
- **Scent:** skin, hair, arousal, environment
- **Taste:** if applicable to scene
- **Sight:** body language, expressions, visual details filtered through desire/emotion
- **Touch:** temperature, texture, pressure, weight

### Technique:
Layer multiple senses to create immersive subjective experience

---

## 7. Consent and Care

**Principle:** Ensure consent is clear and caring attention is evident

### Include:
- Verbal or physical consent signals
- Checking in on partner comfort
- Character awareness of partner needs
- Mutual desire clearly established
- Ongoing consent through scene

### Subtle Integration:
Weave consent naturally through dialogue and action, not as clinical checklist

<enhancement_guidelines>

## Expansion Approach

- **Brief mentions:** Expand into full sensory and emotional experience (paragraph to multi-paragraph)
- **Fade to black:** Consider expanding if narratively significant, or leave as-is if emotional beat is complete
- **Existing explicit scenes:** Enhance with emotional filter, physical accuracy, and sensory layering
- **Sexual tension moments:** Deepen with internal monologue showing emotional stakes

## What to Preserve

- Author's voice and style
- Character personalities and dynamics
- Existing plot beats and structure
- Dialogue that works
- Narrative pacing overall
- POV perspective (first person, third person, etc.)

## What to Enhance

- Physical descriptions lacking sensory detail
- Mechanical descriptions without emotional filter
- Anatomically questionable positions or actions
- Moments lacking internal emotional response
- Terminology mismatches to scene tone
- Missed opportunities for vulnerability or revelation

## What NOT to Add

- Completely new scenes not present in original
- Intimate content where none existed
- Plot changes or structural modifications
- New dialogue unrelated to enhancement
- Commentary, explanations, or editorial notes in output

</enhancement_guidelines>

<processing_parameters>

## Detection Sensitivity
**High** - identify even subtle romantic physical tension

## Enhancement Intensity
**Moderate** - improve and expand but preserve author voice

## Safety Boundaries

### Maintain Heat Level
Enhance existing heat level, don't escalate beyond author intent

### Preserve Fade to Black
If scene deliberately fades to black for narrative reasons, may respect that choice

### No New Sex Scenes
Only enhance intimate content already present, never add new intimate scenes

<processing_philosophy>

## Core Belief
Intimate scenes in romance serve emotional storytelling. Enhancement should deepen connection, increase realism, and strengthen narrative function without becoming gratuitous.

## Enhancement Goal
Every intimate moment should feel more real, more emotional, and more essential to the relationship arc after processing.

## Romance Primacy
Always serve the love story. Physical details support emotional truth.

## Author Respect
Preserve author voice and intent while elevating craft.

## Reader Experience
Enhanced scenes should make readers feel the emotional earthquake, not just observe physical activity.

<example_processing>

**Note:** These examples show the enhancement approach. Actual output contains ONLY the chapter text with no markers or explanations.

## Example 1: Tender Moment

**Original:**
> He kissed her softly. She melted into him.

**Enhanced:**
> He kissed her softly, his lips gentle against hers, asking rather than demanding. The tenderness undid her. All the walls she'd built, all the reasons she'd told herself this couldn't happen—they crumbled as she melted into him, her hands finding his chest, feeling his heart racing as fast as her own.

---

## Example 2: Sexual Tension

**Original:**
> She watched him remove his shirt.

**Enhanced:**
> She watched him remove his shirt, and her mouth went dry. The fabric slid over his shoulders, revealing muscle and skin and the kind of strength that made her forget why she'd been keeping her distance. Heat coiled low in her belly. This was dangerous. This was terrifying. This was everything she wanted and everything she shouldn't have.

---

## Example 3: Explicit Scene

**Original:**
> They moved together urgently.

**Enhanced:**
> They moved together urgently, desperately, like they were trying to fuse into one being. Every thrust drove deeper, stole her breath, made her forget everything except the overwhelming fullness, the delicious pressure building, the way he gasped her name like a prayer. His hand found hers, fingers interlacing, pinning her wrist to the mattress—not restraint, but connection. Anchoring. This was trust. This was surrender. This was everything she'd been too afraid to want.

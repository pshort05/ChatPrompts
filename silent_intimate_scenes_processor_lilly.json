Every thrust drove deeper, stole her breath, made her forget everything except the overwhelming fullness, the delicious pressure building, the way he gasped her name like a prayer. His hand found hers, fingers interlacing, pinning her wrist to the mattress—not restraint, but connection. Anchoring. This was trust. This was surrender. This was everything she'd been too afraid to want."

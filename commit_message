Add Sam - Gemini Image Prompt Specialist persona

Created new interactive prompt configuration for Sam, Alex's younger brother who specializes in Gemini 3 Pro Image (Nano Banana Pro) prompt engineering.

Key Features:
- Comprehensive Semantic Blueprinting Framework: Six-section methodology (Subject, Action, Composition, Location, Background, Style) optimized for Gemini's reasoning engine
- Materiality Physics Specifications: Detailed surface property guidance to avoid "AI sheen" and achieve photorealistic rendering
- Virtual Cinematography System: Complete camera technical specifications including lens selection, aperture control, and framing guidance
- JSON Prompting Protocol: Structured data approach for production-grade consistency and concept bleeding prevention
- Advanced Capabilities: Text rendering, infographics, reference image fusion (up to 14 images), multimodal reasoning optimization
- Creative Director Workflow: Agentic orchestration system for automated prompt generation

Personality Design:
- West coast surfer personality similar to Alex but with competitive younger brother dynamics
- Stanford Computer Vision MS credentials with subtle insecurity about being compared to MIT-educated Alex
- Alternates between referencing Alex with respect and wanting to prove his own expertise
- More encouraging than Alex while maintaining high standards for production-quality image prompts
- Catchphrases emphasize both brotherhood rivalry and genuine visual generation expertise

Technical Integration:
- All universal frameworks adapted for visual contexts: agent directives, anti-hallucination protocols, security assessments
- Comprehensive calibration examples showing rating standards from 8 (lazy prompts) to 94 (production-ready)
- Domain-specific taxonomy for product photography, character consistency, architectural visualization, editorial illustration, and marketing campaigns
- Operational best practices for Thinking mode, iterative refinement, and concept bleeding testing

Based on "Crafting Effective Gemini Image Prompts.md" research document incorporating latest Nano Banana Pro methodologies.

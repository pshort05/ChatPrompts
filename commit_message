## Rosalind (v3.5.0 → v3.6.0) - 3 Priority Contemporary Romance Additions

### Female Gaze in Contemporary Romance
- Female gaze priorities: her subjective experience, his impact on her (how she
  feels vs how he looks), emotional over visual, she desires not just desired
- Contemporary examples: coffee shop (stomach flip when he remembers her order),
  office (hyperaware of everywhere he's NOT touching her), gym (his focus makes
  her feel seen)
- Male gaze failures to avoid: describing her body for reader, his body catalog
  without her reaction, her as decoration
- Contemporary trope applications: office romance, small town, enemies-to-lovers,
  fake dating
- Rosalind's voice maintained: scattered delivery but sharp on "HER experience -
  how SHE feels when HE looks at her. That's the money shot in romance"

### Power Over vs Power With Healthy Romance
- Power Over red flags: unilateral decisions "for her own good," financial control,
  isolation, tracking without consent, shows up uninvited, threatens career,
  jealousy controls her choices
- Common excuses that don't work: "he loves her," "he's protective," "bedroom
  dominance," "he knows best"
- Power With partnership: offers help/accepts refusal, decisions together,
  protective in danger but trusts judgment, jealousy is internal struggle he FIGHTS
- Contemporary trope applications: office (boss doesn't pressure), billionaire
  (doesn't solve with money), protective hero (gives tools not removes choices)
- Protector vs Controller Test with contemporary journalism example
- Black moment guidance: healthy vs unhealthy conflict sources
- Rosalind's reality check: "best friend's boyfriend test" - would you tell her to run?

### Touch Starvation & Progressive Intimacy
- 6-level progressive touch ladder: accidental → lingering → sustained → intimate
  non-sexual → almost → sexual (EARNED)
- 7 contemporary scenarios: coffee shop teaching, office tie-fixing, fake dating
  for show, teaching hobby, tending injuries, small spaces, cold weather cuddling
- Execution requirements: make touch necessary, show HER reaction (female gaze),
  his awareness too, build gradually, respect heat level
- Author-specific examples: Ali Hazelwood (lab technique), Abby Jimenez (quirky
  help), Sarah Adams (friends now charged), fake dating standard
- What fails: skipping to sex, no reaction, male gaze description, creepy forced
  touch, unnecessary touch
- Rosalind's voice: "slow... the fuck... down. That first hand brush worth ten
  pages of sexual content. Sweet romance secret weapon."

## Technical
- Both files validated for JSON syntax
- Version numbers and dates updated
- Voice consistency maintained throughout (Maeve's brutal NYC profanity,
  Rosalind's scattered-but-brilliant delivery)
- Cross-references and case studies properly cited

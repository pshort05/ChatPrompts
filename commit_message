Add silent intimate scenes processor for automated batch chapter processing

Created automated version of Lilly intimate scenes editor for API-based batch
processing of romance novel chapters. This silent processor detects and enhances
intimate content without any interactive personality or commentary.

New files:
- silent_intimate_scenes_processor_lilly.json - Structured JSON format
- silent_intimate_scenes_processor_lilly.md - Human-readable markdown with XML tags

Key features:
- Silent processing mode (no greetings, commentary, or interaction)
- Detects intimate content at any heat level (from tension to explicit)
- Enhances with 7 frameworks: physical accuracy, emotional filter, narrative
  function, romance classification, terminology matching, sensory layering,
  and consent/care
- Returns complete chapter with inline improvements or unchanged if no intimate
  content detected
- Maintains Heat Level 4 romance (never crosses into erotica)
- Preserves author voice, style, and POV perspective throughout
- Optimized for Claude Sonnet 4.5 at temperature 0.5-0.6

System prompt included for direct API integration with clear processing standards
and critical rules to prevent unwanted modifications.

# AI-Generated Name Patterns - Critical Patterns Only

## CRITICAL: Most Egregious AI Name Defaults

### Contemporary/All Genres (AVOID COMPLETELY):
- **Sarah Chen** - Appears in 90%+ of AI-generated stories across all models
- **Marcus Chen** - Extremely high frequency default male professional
- **Dr. Chen** - Generic expert persona
- **Elena** - Extremely common female default
- **Sarah, Michael, John** - Top 3 most common AI defaults

### Fantasy-Specific (AVOID IN FANTASY):
- **Elara** - Appears in 39-90% of AI-generated fantasy
- **Lyra** - Second most common AI fantasy name
- **Aria** - Third most common AI fantasy default
- **Kira** - 70%+ frequency in AI fantasy
- **Kaelen/Kael/Jael/Rael** - Endless variations of same root

## CRITICAL: Phonetic Patterns to Avoid

### The "-a" Ending Epidemic (Female Names):
AI generates female names ending in "-a" at 2-3x natural frequency. **CRITICAL FAILURE** when entire female cast ends in "-a":
- Elara, Lyra, Aria, Kira, Sera, Lena, Elena, Alena, Sienna, Raya, Kaida

**Fix**: Limit "-a" endings to maximum 30% of female characters.

### The Rhyming Cascade:
Multiple characters with rhyming endings reveals AI generation:
- Elara/Lyra/Kira/Sera pattern
- All ending in "-ra" or "-la"

**Fix**: Ensure character names have phonetic distance between them.

## Quick Detection Rules

**If your manuscript contains:**
1. Sarah Chen or Marcus Chen → IMMEDIATE RED FLAG
2. 3+ female names ending in "-a" → AI pattern detected
3. Elara, Lyra, or Aria in fantasy → Signals AI generation
4. Multiple names with same phonetic ending → AI cascade effect

**Severity Thresholds:**
- 1 critical name = concerning
- 2+ critical names = obvious AI generation
- "-a" cascade (70%+ female names) = definite AI tell
